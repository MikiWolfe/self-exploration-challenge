# 30 Days of Self-Exploration ðŸ§­ 

## How It Works
This application is a tool that was created to direct users in a 30-day journey of self-exploration. The app suggests daily activities based on selected parameters, it provides a link to a Myers-Briggs personality quiz, and then it gives the opportunity to reflect and journal about your experience.

## User Story

```
AS AN individual looking for self-betterment
I WANT to be presented with new ideas for activities that I can participate in
SO THAT I can explore my passions and try new things as part of the 30-Day Self-Exploration challenge
```

## Acceptance Criteria
